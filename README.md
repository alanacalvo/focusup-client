# FocusUp
A productivity app geared towards users with ADHD, or users that want to improve their focus. This app is designed to help the user stay on track and reach their personal goals during the timed sessions they set aside for productivity. Whether the users productivity session has been 'successful' or not, they will have the ability to record different factors that may have had an effect on such, such as nutrition, sleep, hydration, medication intake, etc. All of these details will be stored in a productivity session history inside of each users profile, so they can reflect back on these factors.

# User Stories

## MVP 
As a user, I can create an account.

As a user, I can log into my personal account and view or create focus sessions.

As a user, I can personalize each session with session length, session type, and a list of to-dos to be worked on during that session.

As a user, I can see a timer that counts down my session time.

As a user, once the session is over, I will be prompted with my initial todo list and have the ability to check off the tasks that I have completed. I will also have the ability to write notes and rate my session. I will then be prompted with a survey to keep track of different factors that may have affected my personal progress during that session.

As a user, I can navigate to my session history.

As a user, I can log out of my account.

As a user, I can delete past sessions.

## Stretch Goals

As a user, I can log into my account via google or facebook.

As a user, while personalizing the session, I can toggle to a pomodoro session and once session is started, a pomodoro timer will be activated and alert me during the session at the appropriate times.

As a user, I will receive notifications periodically (based on session length) that ask me if I'm staying on track.

As a user, if I am inactive for x amount of minutes, I will be notified asking if I am still on track.

As a user, I can exit the browser and still come back to my active session.

As a user, I can plan future sessions via a calendar.

As a user, I will be notified when a scheduled session is coming up.

As a user, I will be blocked from using social media sites while in session.

# Features to Add in the Future
- I would like to expand my app to be a social platform, where the users can uplift each other and hold each other accountable. The ability to share session history and easy quick meals is a main goal for me.
- I would like to implement a photo upload to be able to quickly and easily upload photos of simple meals so the user can never forget their quick and easy meal ideas. This will carry on to a mobile app feature as well, giving the app access to upload or take photos.
